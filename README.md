### Mobile Robotic Plateform

This project is about creating a mobile robot from scratch.
There are four major parts in this project :

- Mechanics : Build a differential drive plateform with two DC motors with encoders. The different components must be build with Laser cutting and 3D printing (from low cost websites).
			
- Electronics : Create a main board based on a STM32F4 microcontroller with many components like motors, sensors, actuators, RF transmitters...
			
- Firmware : This can go two ways:
	- Provide a sets of high level librairies for controlling a sets of sensors and actuators and example projects, 
	- Give the code as is but with a performant way of interfacing with it (serial communication)

- Documentation : All the informations to understand the project will be there, with some tutorials. At the moment, used to store local datasheets
			
The aim of this projects is to propose some basics to start mobile robotic for the beginners and to simplify things for advanced people.
