Author : DIB Guillaume

Beginning date : 09/2013

This project is about creating a mobile robot from scratch.
There are four malor parts in this project :

- Mechanics : Build a differential drive plateform with two DC motors with encoders.
			The different components must be build with Laser cutting and 3D printing
			(from low cost websites).
			
- Electronics : Create a main board based on a dsPIC33F microcontroller and several 
			shields to interface with many components like motors, sensors, actuators,
			RF transmitters...
			
- Embedded software : Propose a basic template for the microcontroller and many
			librairies to easily control the robot.

- Documentation : All the information to understand the project will be there, with some
			tutorials.
			
The aim of this projects is to propose some basics to start mobile robotic for the beginners
and to simplify things for advanced people.
